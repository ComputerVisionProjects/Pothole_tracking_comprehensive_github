# Pothole_Tracking_Comprehensive
This project implements a lightweight monocular-depth-estimation system optimized for extremely low compute environments, enabling real-time distance and structural estimation of road obstacles from a single camera. Designed for automotive deployment, it integrates seamlessly into vehicle tracking pipelines to provide accurate depth cues, spatial awareness, and hazard monitoring without reliance on LiDAR, stereo vision, or high-power GPUs â€” making it practical for large-scale, on-road use in cost-constrained smart-mobility systems.
